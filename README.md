### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

These are the projects I have been working on lately:

## Web Scraping with Github Actions
1. I am scraping every film shown in Spanish public tv, namely TDT. I get data about the date, time, channel and some variables on the film shown (title, director, length, country, etc): [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Automatic-Web-Scraping-of-Spanish-TDT-Films).
2. Here I scrape the sport programs shown in Spanish public sports channel, Teledeporte. Eventually I would like to explore how different sports are distributed in the channel: [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Automatic-Web-Scraping-of-Teledeporte).
3. In this repository I scrape a local cinema: [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Automatic-Web-Scraping-of-A-Local-Cinema).
4. I scrape Spanish football data (only first division): [repository]().

## Models in R with tidymodels

### Classification
1. Very basic logistic regression applied to Kaggle titanic competition: [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/main/titanic/logistic_regression.R).
2. Random forest applied to Kaggle titanic competition: [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/main/titanic/random_forest.R).
3. XGBoost applied to Kaggle titanic competition with some parameter tuning: [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Kaggle-Competitions/blob/main/titanic/xgboost.R).

## SQL
1. I created a personal music database to learn something about the design of it and to have some personal data to practice with for online SQL courses: [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Design-and-Creation-of-a-Basic-Music-Database).
