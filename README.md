### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

These are the projects I have been working on lately:

## Web Scraping with Github Actions
1. I am scraping every film shown in Spanish public tv, namely TDT. I get data about the date, time, channel and some variables on the film shown (title, director, length, country, etc): [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Automatic-Web-Scraping-of-Spanish-TDT-Films).
2. Here I scrape the sport programs shown in Spanish public sports channel, Teledeporte. Eventually I would like to explore how different sports are distributed in the channel: [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Automatic-Web-Scraping-of-Teledeporte).
3. In this repository I scrape a local cinema: [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Automatic-Web-Scraping-of-A-Local-Cinema).

## Models in R with tidymodels
1. 

## SQL
1. I created a personal music database to learn something about the design and to have some personal data to practice with for online SQL courses: [repository](https://github.com/GuilleDiaz7/Design-and-Creation-of-a-Basic-Music-Database).
